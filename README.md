Early Detection of Stroke Risk: A Machine Learning Approach

Introduction:
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability globally. Early detection of individuals at high risk of developing stroke is critical to enable timely interventions and reduce the burden of stroke on the healthcare system. This project proposes a machine learning approach for stroke prediction that leverages a combination of three classifiers - Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost - to create a robust and accurate prediction model.

Dataset:
To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we utilized a stroke prediction dataset available on Kaggle, which consists of 5110 rows with 11 attributes in total. We performed data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature selection to optimize the dataset for our model.

Methodology:
We utilized three different classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to create a robust and accurate prediction model. We also implemented hyperparameter tuning to search for the optimal set of hyperparameters specific to the stroke dataset, which helped to improve the accuracy of our model.

Performance Metrics:
We evaluated the performance of our model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The results demonstrate that Random Forest had the highest accuracy among the three classifiers, with an accuracy of 95.8%, followed by Decision Tree at 95.7%, and XGBoost with an accuracy of 95.1%. These findings highlight the potential of these classifiers for stroke prediction and emphasize the need for further research in this area.

Future Work:
The findings have the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and effective stroke prediction models, leading to better patient outcomes and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Future work should focus on incorporating more diverse datasets, integrating the model with Electronic Health Records, and exploring the use of CT scan images of the brain to further improve the accuracy of stroke prediction.

Conclusion:
This study presents a novel approach for stroke prediction that can effectively identify individuals at high risk of developing stroke and enable timely interventions. The results showed that our model achieved a significantly higher accuracy compared to existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in accurately predicting stroke occurrences in patients.
